## Frequently Asked Questions

**Uhm, why are you charging for this? Can't we get this free?**

For sure! You can read and watch the same material that we've used ourselves! We highly recommend [JoRo's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8vsQH5AUpQIrT57DgGkrMg) as well as [Resonnance22](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQw1tmt0jiuluT-Jv3VyLyQ), both of which have excellent Fast Castle guides. 

What we're offering is a Fast Castle build orer laid out nicely so you can print it and have it beside you while you play. 

Also, charging for this means we can re-invest and put more time and money into making these guides *better*.

**Alright! What's next?**

Well, if folks are interested and find these guides helpful we'll make more! Our plans include:

* Fast Castle counter guides like tower rushing, archer rushing, monks, etc
* Ongoing updates and refinements to guides as we receive feedback
* Civilization specific guides 
* Maps specific guides
